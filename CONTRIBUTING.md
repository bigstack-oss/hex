## Prerequisites

### Setup Git Commit Signing

Git commit signing is a process that uses cryptographic signatures (GPG or SSH keys) to verify the authenticity of a commits' author, ensuring that the commit was created by a trusted identity and hasnâ€™t been tampered with. We require our contributors to sign their commits to stay secure and validate developer origin certificate sign offs. Setup [Git commit signing](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits)

## Developer Origin Certificate (DCO)

All Bigstack co., ltd open source projects adopt the [Developer Origin Certificate v1.1](https://developercertificate.org/) to ensure contributions are properly authorized and compliant with open-source standards.

Git commit sign-off is a declaration by you that you adhere to the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO), adding a `Signed-off-by:` line in the commit message to confirm you authored or have permission to contribute the changes. The DCO is easily done with the `--signoff (-s)` in Git. For example,

```bash
git commit -s -m "Description of the commit"
```
