# Security Policy

This Bigstack Open Source Project adheres to the [Bigstack co. Itd Vulnerability Reporting Policy](https://www.bigstack.co/trust-center/security).

## How To Report a Vulnerability

If you think you have found a vulnerability in this repository, please report it to us through coordinated disclosure.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public issues, discussions, or change requests.**

Instead, report it using one of the following ways:

- Report a [vulnerability](https://github.com/bigstack-oss/<repository_name>/security/advisories/new) directly via private vulnerability reporting on GitHub
- Contact the [Bigstack Security Team](mailto:security@bigstack.co) via email

Please include as much of the information listed below as you can to help us better understand and resolve the issue:

- The type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, or cross-site scripting)
- Affected version(s)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- Configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Log files that are related to this issue (if possible)
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.
